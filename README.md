Employee Workforce Optimization using GAN Architecture
📌 Overview

This project proposes a modern approach to Workforce Optimization (WFO) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Traditional workforce planning methods rely heavily on historical data and rule-based forecasting, which often fail to handle dynamic workforce complexities and data limitations.

This project leverages GAN-based architecture to generate realistic synthetic workforce data, enabling better forecasting, simulation, and strategic workforce planning.

🎯 Objectives
